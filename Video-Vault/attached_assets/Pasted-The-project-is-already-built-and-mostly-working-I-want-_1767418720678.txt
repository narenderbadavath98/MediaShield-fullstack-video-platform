The project is already built and mostly working.
I want to add, fix, and align features exactly with the Assignment PDF, including the complete workflow demonstration and user journey, without breaking existing functionality.

🔐 Multi-User Access (MANDATORY)

Ensure multiple users can register and log in simultaneously.

Each logged-in user must:

Access only their own uploaded videos

Not see videos uploaded by other users

Enforce multi-tenant isolation using:

uploadedBy: userId


Fix any session or state issues where one user’s data affects another user.

🎥 Video Management Features (ADD & FIX)

For the user who uploaded the video only, implement the following:

1️⃣ Delete Video

Allow uploader to delete their own video

Remove:

Video file from storage

Video record from database

Block deletion by other users

2️⃣ Rename Video

Allow uploader to edit the video title

Update the database

Reflect changes instantly in the UI

3️⃣ Download Video

Allow uploader to download their own video

Use a secure download endpoint

Prevent access to other users’ videos

🔐 Authorization Rules

Only the uploader (or Admin) can:

Delete a video

Rename a video

Download a video

Viewer role remains read-only

🔄 Workflow Demonstration (MUST MATCH ASSIGNMENT)

Ensure the application clearly demonstrates the complete user journey:

User Registration / Login

Secure authentication system

Video Upload

Intuitive upload interface

Visible upload progress tracking

Processing Phase

Real-time updates using Socket.io

Sensitivity analysis progress display

Content Review

Clear status display:

Safe

Flagged

Appropriate actions based on status and role

Video Streaming

Seamless playback of processed videos

HTTP range-based streaming

Management Tools

Video library showing all user-uploaded videos

Filtering options (safe / flagged, date)

Management actions (rename, delete, download)

🧼 Code Rules

Do NOT break upload, streaming, authentication, or real-time updates

Do NOT remove RBAC or multi-tenant isolation

Keep clean, production-quality, well-commented code

🎯 Final Goal

Multiple users can log in securely

Each user manages only their own videos

Full workflow from login → upload → processing → review → streaming → management works correctly

All assignment workflow requirements are clearly demonstrated

Apply these changes cleanly and update the project.
